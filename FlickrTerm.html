	<br>
	<p1 style="font-size: 90%"><b>Date of Last Revision: May 29, 2018</b></p1>
	<p>FLICKR USERS: As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc. Your continued use of the Flickr services will be subject to these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use also apply to your use of the Services, where applicable, to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (“Products”) through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (“Flickr Vendors”). For information about how Flickr collects, uses and discloses your information, please see the Flickr Privacy Policy. SmugMug has no control over and no responsibility for any use of your personal information by previous owners or operators of Flickr. Below are Flickr’s new terms and conditions of use (“Terms of Use”) that apply to the Flickr services including the Flickr website (the “Site”) and the Flickr mobile application (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are owned and operated by SmugMug, Inc. and its subsidiaries including Flickr, Inc. and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors (collectively, “SmugMug”). These Terms of Use apply only to the services offered by the Flickr division of SmugMug (“Flickr”) and do not apply to any other services offered by SmugMug. Please see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.</p>
	<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.</p>
	<p>Welcome to the SmugMug family! The Services provide our users with online tools designed to facilitate and share our love of photography and videos and to promote camaraderie. These Terms of Use protect the legal interests of SmugMug, our users and our third party vendors.</p>
	<p>Your use of the Services and your purchase of Products is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use. If you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services. If you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.</p>
	<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.</p>
	<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution). These Terms of Use also contain provisions requiring you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court. If you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.</p>
	<p>SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug. Your continued use of the Services, or your purchase of any Products or the Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Otherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.</p>
	<p>Our Privacy Policy provides information on how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from all users of the Services and/or information obtained through your purchase of Products through the Services.</p><br>

	<p2 style="font-size: 110%"><b></b>15.Dispute Resolution</p2><br>
	<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
		<li>Applicable Law</li>
		<p>Your use of the Services is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations. These Terms of Use and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
		<li>Agreement to Arbitrate & Waiver of Representative Actions</li>
		<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SMUGMUG AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 15, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.</p>
		<p>You and SmugMug agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or Flickr Materials. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and SmugMug agree: (i) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises; (ii) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (iii) that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; and (iv) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable). The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. Other than class procedures and remedies described in these Terms of Use, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and SmugMug are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.</p>
		<p>The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different SmugMug or Flickr users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SmugMug or Flickr user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SMUGMUG OR FLICKR USERS.</p>
		<p>Unless you and SmugMug agree otherwise, in the event that a court decides that any part of this Section 15 is invalid or unenforceable, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and SmugMug must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California. The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply. You and SmugMug agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>
	</ul>
	<p2 style="font-size: 110%"><b>16.Feedback</b></p2>
	<p>We welcome feedback from our users regarding ideas and suggestions for improvements to the Site, Services and Products. SmugMug will be entitled to use any such feedback without restriction, even if you designate such feedback as confidential. You hereby grant SmugMug a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable license in and to any feedback to use in any matter related to the operation of our business.</p>
	<p2 style="font-size: 110%"><b>17.Assignment</b></p2>
	<p>These Terms of Use are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not assign your rights under these Terms of Use without SmugMug’s prior written consent. SmugMug will be permitted to assign its rights under these Terms of Use at its sole discretion.</p>
	<p2 style="font-size: 110%"><b>18.International Users</b></p2>
	<p>SmugMug is located in the State of California in the United States of America. If you access the Services from a country other than the United States, you agree that your transactions with SmugMug occur in the United States. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Services.</p>
	<p2 style="font-size: 110%"><b>19.Severability</b></p2>
	<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect, and, if legally permitted, such offending provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that as nearly as possible effects the parties’ intent.</p>
	<p2 style="font-size: 110%"><b>20.Survival</b></p2>
	<p>The terms and conditions of these Terms of Use which by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration of Services (including, but not limited to, Indemnification, Warranty Disclaimer, Dispute Resolution and the Limitation of Liability) will survive any expiration or termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
